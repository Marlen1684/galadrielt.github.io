        <h3>Self-Learning</h3>
        
          <p>
        I wish I could just download everything I ever wanted to know, like how to code, directly into my brain. 
        But I’m not Neo and this is not the Matrix and that’s of course not possible, yet. I like to think that most 
        things are possible given enough time and knowledge, but until direct knowledge download is available there is 
        self-learning. Self learning is the act of teaching oneself, with or without help from others, what you want 
        to learn, how you want to learn it, and when you want to learn it. This way you can set your own goals, prioritize 
        those goals, find and decide on what materials and resources you want to use to help you reach those goals, and 
        decide on the time frame and rhythm of achieving those learning goals. And it’s never been easier to do so! With 
        access to the internet you can teach yourself almost anything now. Want to learn how to walk the dog with your 
        yo-yo, play the ukulele, or how to code? You can just jump online and google it! Of course there are other ways 
        and resources to aid you in teaching yourself and that’s the beauty of being an autodidact, you get to decide what 
        works best for you! Currently I’m teaching myself how to code. The first step I took on this journey was clarifying 
        why I wanted to learn to code. Doing this has helped me decide what to focus on because there is an overwhelming 
        amount of information out there on how to code! Like so much that it almost kept me from moving forward. But clarifying 
        why I want to learn to code and what I want to do with it once I learn it helps me narrow down what information is 
        useful and what is not. It’s a fluid process and looks like however I need it to look like in order to achieve my 
        desired learning outcomes. There are also many learning methods to teach yourself something. Tim Ferriss has a 
        method for learning anything fast. Jonathan Levi has a method for becoming a superlearner. 
        These are only two examples of methods for learning and teaching yourself anything but there are so many more. 
        And this is great because again it points back to the freedom and flexibility that self-learning offers when figuring out and 
        deciding for yourself what works and what doesn’t. For a good read about teaching oneself to code try Clive Thompson’s

        The words above aren’t even really the ones that used to make my eyes glaze over and my mind go into 
        black and white Fleischer Brothers cartoon mode. As little as 4 months ago I would have said that I wasn’t 
        just not interested in computers, coding, programming, that stuff that those nerds do, but that I was also 
        maybe slightly opposed to it. Not interested to the point of disregarding it as something non-important to 
        me and maybe even suspect. And that’s because I knew nothing about what programmers actually do other than 
        the silly tropes that you see in movies and TV. Also, there’s so much misinformed fear around technology and 
        around those who know how to wield it. Don’t get me wrong, there has been a lot of bad that has been done 
        that couldn’t have been done without tech and there are bad players out there. But that is true for almost 
        everything. Medicine, the arts, humanitarian work, etc., all have a history of bad players abusing their mediums 
        and their platforms. That’s the unfortunate truth about being human and living on this planet. But there’s 
        so much beauty and good that comes from all of it as well. I am not exactly sure what the specific change of 
        heart was for me but once I let a little of the programming light shine in through the cracks of my defensiveness
        it snowballed into a full on obsession. The first thing that I noticed when I looked straight at it instead of 
        giving it all the side-eye was how it made my brain actually feel. It lit me up like I haven’t been since I 
        was a kid in science class. The second thing I noticed was that it energizes me! I always thought programming 
        all day would turn my brains into mushrooms and marshmallows and  twist my body into the shape of the letter C. 
        I was so so wrong. At the end of an all-day marathon of coding and researching at school I go home pumped-up and 
        ready for more! I think about it all day and night. I listen to podcasts in my car on the drive home, I put on 
        audio books about programming while making dinner or taking my walks, I talk about it with whoever will listen, 
        and then I spend the rest of my evening either doing more code or reviewing the things I learned earlier in the day.
        I lean into it like I haven’t anything else. It makes me focus focus focus. And as a trauma survivor who has spent
        her whole life living with complex PTSD and all the ways that it hijacks my brain and body this new ability to focus 
        on something other than my pain and fear has been life-changing. That is putting it mildly. I feel real joy again
        for the first time since I can remember. Programming is creative in ways I never imagined. It brings me so much 
        joy just to make things and to figure things out, it’s like playing with puzzles all day. Knowing that I can use 
        programming to make things that are useful to other people pushes that joy right over the edge into, dare I say it,
        euphoria. I forgot how much I just love to learn and programming requires it. In programming I’m always learning 
        something, which maybe springs from the non-repeating nature of the task. I learn and create and exert my imagination 
        and challenge my inner-complainer and critic. Coding is collaborative and the developer community is refreshingly
        open and immensely supportive. I feel like I have found my people.

        <h3>Do I Really Have to Code 24/7 to Be a Good Programmer?</h3>
          <p>
            I got into the idea of becoming a programmer for several reasons. But the reason that actually got me started on 
            doing the work of becoming a programmer was the excitement other people had about being programmers. They also 
            seemed really happy with their lives. I wanted what they had.<br/> 
            Then I started to hear other things. Things like, to be a good programmer you had to sell your life and soul to 
            the time lords. That to be a good programmer you had to program twenty-four hours a day everyday. That to be a 
            good programmer you had to write code that would create more time in which you could then use to do more programming. 
            I panicked a little inside. I know me and I know that I don’t and would never feel that way about anything. Do I give 
            up now or do I try and contort myself into someone else’s idea of a good programmer and just hope that I’ll like it 
            once I’ve mutated?<br/>
            Articles like, How to be TRULY Competitive for Software Jobs, by Raymond Gan started showing up in my sphere. After reading 
            them I would get discouraged. I could see some merits in what they were saying. I could get behind and even get excited 
            to try some of the things they would suggest a good programmer should do. But the general tone of articles like that 
            one would leave me worrying and doubtful of my future potential as a developer. Do I really have to build my own programming 
            language, do I really have to build my own mini version of Rails, do I really have to build my own mini-React from scratch?! 
            I wasn’t worried that I could never do those things, I worried because I knew I probably would never want to do those things.<br/>
            Then this week our class went on some tours of businesses where real life programmers are working. And you know what 
            happened? Not a single one of those programmers ever gave us advice that sounded like or felt like Gandalf shouting, “You shall 
            not pass!” as he brought down his staff to block the path of the Balrog Demon in pursuit. No, they said things like, “I love 
            my job”, “I love the people I work with,” “I love the company I work for,”  “I love the projects I get to work on,” “I don’t 
            do a lot of coding after work,”  “I go home and hang with my friends and family after work,” and “Sometimes I do a little 
            coding on the side but it’s for fun!”<br/>
            They encouraged us to study and study hard, to do a little coding every day so we didn’t lose the skill, to get connected 
            and ask questions, but to also have a life and to take care of ourselves. I liked every place we visited. I liked the 
            culture they built in their workplaces. I liked the way they never felt like their work was work. I liked the way they 
            treated their profession and each other. I found myself once again wanting what they have.
